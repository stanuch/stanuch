### Hey!

I'm **Aleksander**, a Molecular and Cellular Biophysics student with a strong interest in bioinformatics.

My main areas of interest are microscopy image analysis and DNA-level biological data. 
I have hands-on experience in academic research and microscopy imaging, and I’m currently developing Python-based projects that combine biological data analysis with machine learning. My goal is to build tools that help make sense of biological data and support data-driven research.
