### Hey!

I'm **Aleksander**.

A 4th-year Molecular and Cellular Biophysics student from Cracow, Poland.

I'm curious about how biology works and I’m trying to convince code to help me out.

I like (and am doing my best) to build tools that help make sense of biological data.

### About me
I build small **bioinformatics tools** that analyze and visualize biological data — things like GC content calculators, sequence aligners, and molecular data explorers. I enjoy connecting **biology, programming, and data analysis** to understand how molecular systems work beneath the surface. Currently, I’m focusing on **advanced data analysis**, **computational biology**, and **machine learning**, aiming to combine science with data-driven approaches. I code mostly in **Python**, occasionally experimenting with web tools to make science more interactive and accessible.
